This project is a minimal Campus Event Reporting API that allows colleges to manage events, student registrations, attendance, and feedback along with providing various reports such as event popularity, attendance percentage, average feedback, student participation, and top students wher there would be many feature like adding adresss and develop a fully fledged web application for the sake of monitoring and adding teh evenys and managing it and ther will be a mobile aplicatin wher student sget to acces the event details and tickets for the event adn get insights whic can hel the campus to manage time and effort.

Now lets break the working of the workflow: \n

-> First the admin create the event with the help of the website which is only accesible for the campus management.

-> Now the student gets notification the=at an event is being hosted and they register for the event.

-> On the event day the student checks by scanning the ticket and thus the database is updated for the students who have scaned the Qr code.

-> After the event the student submits the feedback (1-5).

-> Now the management can generate the repost on how many students have attendded the event and how many have not.
